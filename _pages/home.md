### Welcome!

Structural Ecology is the study of how organisms interact with the 2- and 3-dimensional structure of their environment.
In practice, this means trying to understand how animals respond to their surroundings as revealed by their movement, and the implication of this for their ability to survive and thrive on that landscape.
Our lab studies metapopulation dynamics, individual and collective animal movements in complex landscapes, and other issues of spatial ecology and conservation. We collaborate closely with the Swarm Lab at NJIT.

### About me

I am an ecologist working in the field of spatial ecology and animal movement.
I received my undergraduate degree in zoology from Oxford University in 1992 and went on to earn my PhD from The University of Tennessee in 1996.
After completing my doctoral studies I worked at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis and Columbia University before joining the New Jersey Institute of Technology in 2005.
