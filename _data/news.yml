  "This is a collaboration with Benjamin Thomas of NJIT’s Department of Physics. Ben’s lab has developed a cool IR laser device — the eBOSS — for non-destructive detection and identification of flying insects. In this case it was used to count mosquitoes in an urban area of NJ, and these counts are compared to traditional methods. I helped with the power analysis. Going forward we plan to see if the eBOSS can sample pollinator communities to a useful taxonomic resolution. [https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/15/8/584](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/15/8/584)"
